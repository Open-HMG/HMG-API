# Using the HMG-API app

Open **HMG-API** from the app menu (or put it on a ★ key).

**No HMG-API tile in the app menu?** The tile and the ★ choice are added by HMG-API's
hooks, so a car without a hook map yet doesn't get them. Open the app from **NEMESIS
Manager → My Packages → HMG-API → Launch** instead, or over adb:
`adb shell "hmgapid sh 'sh /data/hmgapi/open.sh'"`. Both install the app first if it's
missing.

## The top bar

- **Status**: whether HMG-API's hooks are on for your car, **Changes not applied**
  (switches or settings saved but not applied yet) and **Restart needed** (a mod with
  code was turned on or off, or a setting that takes effect at the next start).
- **Apply changes**: shows a plan of everything that will change, then applies it.
- **Check USB updates**: HMG-API releases and mod packages in `HMGAPI/updates/` on a USB stick.
- **Restart unit**.

## Mods

![Mods](images/mods.png)

Every installed mod, with its state:

| Colour | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🟢 green | on and running |
| 🟡 yellow | a conflict: two mods replace the same thing; turn one off |
| 🔴 red | not running on this car (it needs a hook point your car's map doesn't have yet), or an error. It says why; a [Car Report](Car-Report) helps get it added |
| ⚪ grey | off |

Pick a mod for its switch, its settings, its log (HMG-API's lines for it and its
services' output) and **Remove**.

## Settings

![Settings](images/settings.png)

- **Vehicle**: HMG-API asks you before a mod's first use of a car command (seat
  heat, charge door, ambient light…), once per mod and command. Giving back what a
  mod took never asks. Also the startup notice and ambient light switches.
- **Updates**: over-the-air updates (blocked by default, so an update can't replace
  what HMG-API and your mods depend on; USB and dealer updates still work).
- **Phone projection**: what mods change in Android Auto and CarPlay.
- **Hook map**: your car's map, a check of it, mapping your car from its own software,
  and trying maps that haven't been checked on a car yet.
- **About**.

## Car Report

## Logs

HMG-API's log since the head unit started: everything, HMG-API itself, mods, or only
warnings and errors.

## Apply changes: the plan

Switching a mod on or off and changing its settings are saved at once, and many mods
pick the change up right away. Anything that changes files waits for **Apply
changes**, which first shows the plan, for example:

```
app      dev.example.player (app/Player.apk) [player]
service  dashcam/recorder as root, at boot, restarted if it stops [dashcam]
vehicle  reads gear.park, speed [dashcam]
vehicle  may charge_door (gear in P; once every 5 s) [chargeport]
button   map hold (instead of the car's) -> tells its app dev.example.OPEN_DOOR [chargeport]
panel    "Battery" (dev.example/.BatteryWidget) in the side panel [battery]
projection Android Auto density 200 [aadpi]
```

`problem` lines are things HMG-API won't do, with the reason. Nothing else is
affected. If the plan says a restart is needed, the app offers it.
